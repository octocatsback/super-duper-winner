Gemini Live API Toolkit in ADK adds the low-latency bidirectional voice and video interaction
capability of [Gemini Live API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live) to
AI agents.

With ADK Gemini Live API Toolkit, you can provide end users with the experience of natural,
human-like voice conversations, including the ability for the user to interrupt
the agent's responses with voice commands. Agents with streaming can process
text, audio, and video inputs, and they can provide text and audio output.

-   :material-console-line: **Streaming Tools**

    ---

    Streaming tools allow tools (functions) to stream intermediate results back to agents and agents can respond to those intermediate results. For example, we can use streaming tools to monitor the changes of the stock price and have the agent react to it. Another example is we can have the agent monitor the video stream, and when there are changes in video stream, the agent can report the changes.
